<p xmlns:ns0="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">To calculate recombination rates we used LDHat version 2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000831-McVean1">[57]</xref> with minor modifications. We have used the complete Phase II data (phased genotypes from release 21a) from the HapMap project as a source of genotypes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.hapmap.org">www.hapmap.org</ext-link> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000831-1">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000831-Frazer1">[63]</xref>). Hotspots were defined as relatively narrow peaks (peak width &lt;100 Kb) having strength above 0.01 cM. All coordinates are given relative to the NCBI35 version of the human genome assembly. Statistical calculations were performed in JMP version 7. This study utilized the high-performance computational capabilities of the Biowulf Linux cluster at the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://biowulf.nih.gov">http://biowulf.nih.gov</ext-link>).</p><p>DNA samples from the CEPH/UTAH pedigrees 1334, 1340, 1341, 1350, 1362, 1408, 1420, 1447, 1454 and 1459 were obtained from the Coriell cell repository. Samples were genotyped using Affymetrix 500K genotyping array sets according to recommendations of the manufacturer. To map crossovers we developed a multi-step algorithm (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000831.s023">Text S1</xref>) based on mendelian inheritance.</p>
