The AGES is a prospective study with subject recruitment from 2002&#8211;2006 of 5,764 surviving members, aged 66 years and older, of the established Reykjavik Study, a cohort of 19,381 participants assembled in 1967 to study cardiovascular disease and its risk factors among those born between 1907 and 1935 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001184-Harris1">[22]</xref>. The ARIC study enrolled 15,792 men and women (including 11,478 non-Hispanic whites) from four U.S. communities to investigate the etiology and sequelae of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular risk factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001184-The1">[23]</xref>. Participants were between age 45 and 64 years at their baseline examination in 1987&#8211;1989.

In brief, participants underwent retinal photography and optic disc-centered images were used to measure vascular caliber. Pharmacological mydriasis was used in the AGES and Rotterdam studies. For ARIC, CHS and Rotterdam the photographs of one eye were digitized using a high-resolution scanner and for the AGES study, photographs of both eyes were captured digitally. All digital retinal images were analyzed with a semi-automated retinal vessel measurement system and the calibers of all retinal arterioles and venules were measured in an area between half and one disc-diameter from the optic disc margin. The Parr-Hubbard-Knudtson formulae were used to compute summary measures for retinal arteriolar and venular calibers in micrometers (&#181;m) and referred to as the &#8220;central retinal arteriolar and venular equivalents&#8221; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001184-Knudtson1">[44]</xref>. Quality control (QC) measures for intergrader and intragrader intraclass correlation coefficients for retinal vascular calibers for each of the cohorts ranged from 0.76&#8211;0.99 in AGES, 0.69&#8211;0.89 in ARIC, 0.67&#8211;0.91 in CHS to 0.67&#8211;0.95 in the Rotterdam Study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001184-Hubbard1">[4]</xref>, .</p><p>The consortium was formed after the individual studies had finalized their GWAS platform selection. The four studies included used different platforms: the Affymetrix GeneChip SNP Array 6.0 for the ARIC study, Illumina HumanCNV370-Duo for the AGES study and the CHS and the Illumina Infinium HumanHap550-chip v3.0 for the Rotterdam Study. All studies used their genotype data to impute to the 2.2 million non-monomorphic, autosomal, SNPs identified in HapMap (CEU population).

For the CHS and ARIC studies, the analyses were additionally adjusted for study site. We used linear regression models to calculate regression coefficients (beta) and their standard errors (SE) using the ProbABEL program (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://mga.bionet.nsc.ru/~yurii/ABEL/">http://mga.bionet.nsc.ru/~yurii/ABEL/</ext-link>) in AGES, ARIC and Rotterdam study and the R software in CHS (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://www.r-project.org">http://www.r-project.org</ext-link>).

The four replication sample sets included 1,709 participants from the Australian Twins Study, 1,132 from the UK Twins Study, 2,501 from the BDES and 1,310 from the BMES. Retinal vascular caliber measurements used the same methodology and formulas as in the CHARGE cohorts.
