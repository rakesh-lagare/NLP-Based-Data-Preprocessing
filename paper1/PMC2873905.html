<p>Two genomic DNA fragments (2.8 and 6 kb) flanking the 3&#8242; portion of the first exon of whirlin were amplified from 129/Sv mouse genomic DNA by PCR, and inserted separately as the short and long arm into a modified pGT-N29 vector, which contained a diphtheria toxin expression cassette as a negative selection marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000955-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). The targeting vector was linearized and electroporated into R1 embryonic stem (ES) cells. An ES clone was found to have the partial replacement of the first exon of whirlin by the Neo<sup>r</sup> gene, and was microinjected into C57BL/6 blastocysts. The resulting chimeras were crossed with C57BL/6 mice. Heterozygous and homozygous knockout mice were identified with respect to the targeted allele by PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000955-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). The MEEI institutional guidelines were followed on all animal procedures.</p><p>A tiny piece of the mouse tail (about 2 mm long) was lysed by proteinase K at 50&#176;C overnight in tissue lysis buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, and 0.2% SDS). The genomic DNA was precipitated from the resulting lysate by adding the same volume of isopropanol and centrifugation. The pellet was finally dissolved in TE buffer. The total RNA was isolated using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. RT (ThermoScript&#8482; RT-PCR system, Invitrogen) and PCR (Expand long template PCR system, Roche Diagnostics) reactions were performed following the manufacturer's instructions.</p><p>Mouse whirlin cDNA fragments (PDZ320, 1&#8211;320 aa; PDZIE, 315&#8211;580 aa, accession number, NP_082916) and frog whirlin cDNA fragment (analogous to mouse whirlin 816&#8211;907 aa) were inserted into the expression vector pET28 (Novagen). Recombinant proteins were expressed as His-tagged fusion proteins in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> host BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIPL. The recombinant proteins were purified through a Ni<sup>2+</sup>-charged nitriloacetic acid agarose column and were used to immunize rabbits and chickens. Whirlin-specific antibodies were affinity-purified from antisera or egg yolk extracts. Usherin antibodies used in this study were raised against the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of the protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000955-Liu1">[26]</xref>. RP1, RPGR and CIP98 antibodies were as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000955-Hong1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000955-Yap1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000955-Liu2">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000955-Hong2">[42]</xref>. VLGR1 antibody was kindly provided by Dr. Perrin C. White (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas). Mass1 (C20) antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Monoclonal anti-&#947;-tubulin and anti-acetylated &#945;-tubulin antibodies were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Alexa fluorochrome-conjugated phalloidin and secondary antibodies, and Hoechst dye 33342 were obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc.</p><p>Mouse whirlin and its fragments (full-length, 3&#8211;907 aa; N-terminus, 3&#8211;472 aa; C-terminus, 438&#8211;907 aa, accession number, NP_082916) and mouse usherin fragment (5053&#8211;5193 aa, accession number, NP_067383) were amplified from the retina and individually cloned into both pGBKT7 and pGADT7 vectors. Yeast two-hybrid analysis was performed as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000955-Yang2">[43]</xref>. Briefly, a protein/peptide in pGBKT7 vector was co-transformed with its putative interacting protein/peptide in pGADT7 vector. Empty pGBKT7 and pGADT7 vectors were used as negative controls. Co-transformants were grown on both SD-4 (-Leu, -Trp, -Ade, and -His) and SD-2 (-Leu and -Trp) plates. The growth on SD-4 plates indicated an existence of interaction between the two co-transformed proteins/peptides. In our experiments, all co-transformants were able to grow on SD-2 plates indicating a successful co-transformation.</p><p>GST pull-down assay: cDNA fragments of intact (mouse: 5053&#8211;5193 aa, NP_067383; frog: analogous to mouse usherin 5053&#8211;5193 aa) and mutant (without PDZ-binding domain, mouse: 5053&#8211;5186 aa, NP_067383; frog: analogous to mouse usherin 5053&#8211;5189 aa) C-terminal usherin were amplified from frog and mouse retinas and cloned into the pGEX4T-1 vector. The GST-fused intact and mutant usherin were expressed in BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIPL cells and then incubated with mouse retinal lysate and glutathione sepharose beads for 2 hours at 4&#176;C. Subsequently, the sepharose beads were washed with lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% TritonX-100, 5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM PMSF, 1&#215; protease inhibitor, and 1 mM DTT) for three times and boiled in Laemmli sample buffer for 10 minutes. All the procedures were performed at 4&#176;C. Retinal lysates incubated with glutathione sepharose beads and GST or only with GST were used as negative controls.</p><p>Immunoprecipitation: Dissected retinal or inner ear tissues were homogenized and incubated for about 60 minutes in lysis buffer. After centrifugation at 18,000 g for 10 minutes, the supernatants were precleared by incubation with protein G sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 hour. Subsequently, they were incubated with the primary antibodies for 3 hours and then centrifuged at 18,000 g for 10 minutes. The resulting supernatants were incubated with protein G sepharose for an additional 1 hour. After a brief centrifugation at 2000 g, the pellets were washed with lysis buffer for four times and then boiled in Laemmli sample buffer. All the procedures were performed at 4&#176;C. A non-immune rabbit IgG served as a negative control. Western blotting was carried out as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000955-Yang2">[43]</xref>.</p><p>Immunofluorescence: Eyes were enucleated, frozen immediately and sectioned at 10-&#181;m thick. Sectioned tissues were fixed in 4% formaldehyde/PBS for 10 minutes (for usherin staining, 2% formaldehyde/PBS for 5 minutes), and permeabilized by 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS for 5 minutes at room temperature. Pup heads on postnatal day 3&#8211;6 were fixed in 4% formaldehyde/PBS for about 36 hours, switched to 30% sucrose/PBS for several days, and sectioned at 30-&#181;m thick. The subsequent steps of blocking and incubation with primary and secondary antibodies were as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000955-Yang2">[43]</xref>. Alexa 488- and 594-conjugated secondary antibodies were routinely used for tissue double-labeling. Stained sections were viewed and photographed on a fluorescent microscope (Olympus, model 1X70) equipped with a digital camera (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.) or on a confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica, model TCS SP2).</p><p>Immunoelectron microscopy: Eyes were enucleated. Their anterior segments and lens were removed. Dissected retina was fixed with 4% formaldehyde/PBS (whirlin) or 2% formaldehyde/0.1% glutaraldehyde/PBS (VLGR1) for 30 minutes, washed with TTBS buffer (Tween/Tris-buffered saline), blocked in 5% goat serum/TTBS for 1 hour, and incubated with the primary antibodies at 4&#176;C overnight. After rinses, the retina was incubated with Nanogold goat anti-rabbit antibody (Aurion, Wageningen, The Netherlands), post-fixed sequentially with 1% formaldehyde/2.5% glutaraldehyde/0.1 M cacodylate buffer and 2% osmium tetroxide. Later, it was silver-enhanced, dehydrated, embedded in Epon, and sectioned at 70 nm thickness. In an alternative protocol, the retina was fixed in 2% formaldehyde/0.1% glutaraldehyde/PBS for 30 minutes, frozen and cut to 10 &#181;m sections prior to staining with primary and secondary antibodies. Staining was done while floating in a dish. After final wash, the sections were post-fixed and processed for immunoEM as above. ImmunoEM for whirlin were studied with both methods which yielded the same results. ImmunoEM for VLGR1 used the alternative protocol.</p><p>Transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy was performed as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000955-Liu1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000955-Yang2">[43]</xref>.</p><p>Measurements of photoreceptor outer segment length and outer nuclear layer thickness were made along the vertical meridian (superior to inferior) at five locations to each side of the optic nerve head separated by approximately 600 &#181;m each. Measurements began at approximately 200 &#181;m from the optic nerve head and ended at approximately 200 &#181;m from the retinal periphery. For the analysis in the whirlin knockout mice, seven whirlin knockouts and five whirlin heterozygous littermates from 28&#8211;33 months of age were included. For the analysis in the whirler mice, three whirler mice aged from 28&#8211;33 months and two age-matched wild-type mice were included.</p><p>Photoreceptors with abnormal morphology around the PMC were counted at the retinal mid-periphery. Abnormal morphology was defined as membrane fusion between the apical inner segment and the distal connecting cilium or vacuole accumulation in the apical inner segment around the PMC. The presence of at least 3 large vacuoles (diameter is larger than 200 nm) or 4 small vacuoles (diameter is about 100 nm) was considered as vacuole accumulation. Four wild-type and six whirlin knockout mice at the age from 5 to 24 months were included in this experiment.</p><p>The Student's <italic>t</italic>-test was conducted to compare the measured values of whirlin knockout and control mice. A <italic>P</italic> value of less than 0.05 was considered to indicate a significant difference between the two groups.</p><p>ERG and DPOAE recordings were performed as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000955-Liu1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000955-Yang3">[44]</xref>.</p>
