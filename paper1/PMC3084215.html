<p>All strains are haploid derivatives of two isogenic haploid yeast strains MWJ49 and MWJ50 (<italic>MAT</italic>&#945; <italic>leu2-3,112 ade5-1 his7-2 ura3D trp1-289</italic>) which contain a circularized chromosome III and has the construct <italic>lys2</italic>::Alu-DIR-<italic>LEU2</italic>-<italic>lys2D5&#8242;</italic> on Chr II <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002059-Ma2">[28]</xref>. The construction of strains with circular Chr III was described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002059-Ma2">[28]</xref>. Deletion strains of <italic>apn1</italic>, <italic>apn2</italic>, <italic>rad50</italic>, <italic>rad51</italic>, <italic>rad52</italic>, <italic>mre11</italic>, <italic>mag1</italic>, <italic>ntg1</italic>, <italic>ntg2</italic>, <italic>ogg1</italic> and derived multiple mutants were created by replacement of the relevant open reading frame with selectable markers by PCR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002059-Wach1">[61]</xref>. Temperature-sensitive mutants of <italic>mcd1-1</italic> in wild type or <italic>apn1/2</italic> background were generated using plasmid pVG257 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002059-Unal1">[41]</xref>. Experiments were done at 30&#176;C, unless specifically stated at a different temperatue.</p><p>The generation of G2 arrested cells was described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002059-Argueso1">[62]</xref>. Briefly, logarithmically growing cells in YPDA medium (1% yeast extract, 2% Bacto-Peptone, 2% dextrose, 60 mg/ml adenine sulfate) were incubated with nocodazole at a final concentration of 15 &#181;g/mL. After 3 hours, most cells are arrested in G2/M as determined microscopically by the presence of large budded cells and verification using flow cytometry. Cells were then harvested by centrifugation, washed and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 10 mM phosphate, 0.138 M NaCl; 0.0027 M KCl, pH 7.4). MMS treatment was performed as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002059-Ma2">[28]</xref> with modification. Cells in PBS were incubated with 11.8 mM (0.1%) MMS for 15 or 30 min at 30&#176;C with vigorous shaking, and then neutralized by mixing 1&#8758;1 (v/v) ratio with 10% Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. After washing with dH<sub>2</sub>0, a portion of the MMS-treated cells was immediately resuspended in ice-cold cell suspension buffer (10 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 100 mM EDTA) to prepare DNA-agarose plug for pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) as described below. Other portions of the MMS-treated and control cells were resuspended in YPDA media containing nocodazole and incubated at 30&#176;C with constant shaking. Cells were collected up to 16 hours after MMS treatment, centrifuged, wash with dH<sub>2</sub>0 and resuspended in cell suspension buffer for PFGE DNA-agarose plug preparation.</p><p>Nocodazole-arrested G2 cells were first incubated with MX (final concentration 100 mM) in YPDA for 15&#8211;30 min to first allow MX diffuse into cells. Then MMS treatment and post-treatment incubation were as described above with MX (final concentration 100 mM) present during the whole procedure. Cells were then collected at various times for plug preparation and PFGE analysis.</p><p>Detection of DSBs and repair intermediates (such as resected DNA molecule) were based on PFGE analysis as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002059-Ma2">[28]</xref>. PFGE was performed using a Bio-Rad CHEF-Mapper XA system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Preparation of agarose-embedded DNA (DNA plug) was described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002059-Ma2">[28]</xref>. Briefly, control and MMS-treated cells collected at different times following MMS treatment were embedded in 0.6% agarose with 1 mg/ml Zymolyase (100 U/mg, MP Biochemicals, Solon, OH). The plug was incubated for 1 h at 30&#176;C in a &#8220;spheroplasting&#8221; solution (1 M sorbitol, 20 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris pH 7.5) to remove the cell wall. This was followed by digestion with proteinase K (10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mM EDTA, 1.0% N-lauroylsarcosine, 0.2% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mg/ml proteinase K) for 24 hours at 30&#176;C. Increasing the time of proteinase treatment did not influence the DNA mobility characteristics on PFGE. The parameters for CHEF gel separation of yeast chromosomes in a 1% agarose gel were 6 V/cm for 24 hours with a 10&#8211;90 sec switch time ramp and 120&#176; switch angle (running buffer at the 14&#176;C). Subsequently, the DNA was analyzed by Southern blotting as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002059-Ma2">[28]</xref>. Hybridization was carried out with a probe for the <italic>CHAI</italic> gene to detect specifically Chr III material or a probe to the <italic>LEU2</italic> gene that marked both Chr III and Chr II. Autoradiographs were digitized and densitometric analysis was performed using Kodak MI software (version 5.0).</p><p>DNA was digested in agarose plugs with T7 endonuclease I (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). A 50 &#181;l plug slice was equilibrated 3 times for 20 minutes at room temperature in 150 &#181;l of TE (10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA), followed by 30 minute incubation at room temperature with 30 units T7 endonuclease in 150 &#181;L reaction buffer, and stopped by washing 3 times with ice-cold Tris-EDTA (10 mM Tris, 50 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). PFGE analysis was performed as described above.</p>
