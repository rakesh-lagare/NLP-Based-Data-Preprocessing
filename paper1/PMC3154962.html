<p>Adult fish and larvae were maintained at 28.5&#176;C in reverse-osmosis distilled water reconstituted for fish compatibility by addition of salts and vitamins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002239-Westerfield1">[52]</xref> on a 10/14 h dark/light cycle. This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The protocol was approved by IACUC of the University of Washington.</p><p>The <italic>zvm7<sup>w65</sup></italic> mutant was isolated in a three-generation screen of ethyl nitrosourea-mutagenized AB* strain zebrafish using the OKR behavioral assay as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002239-Brockerhoff1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002239-Brockerhoff2">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002239-Stearns1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002239-Brockerhoff4">[53]</xref>. Progeny (between 4&#8211;6 dpf) from crosses between F2 siblings were partially immobilized in 6% methylcellulose (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), and their eye movements were analyzed in response to rotating illuminated stripes. In crosses between <italic>zvm7<sup>w65</sup></italic> heterozygotes, 25% of the larvae showed no eye movements in white light. Fish did not track stripes under any light intensities or stripe widths examined (data not shown). There were no obvious phenotypic differences in electrophysiology or histology between WT and heterozygous <italic>zvm7<sup>w65</sup></italic> fish. For experiments identifying and scoring polymorphisms, a hybrid strain between AB* and WIK was used (also see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref>).</p><p>To visualize ON-bipolar cells, fish heterozygous for the <italic>zvm7<sup>w65</sup></italic> allele were mated to fish carrying the nyx:MYFP transgene. This transgene directs expression of the membrane-targeted form of YFP (yellow fluorescent protein) in a majority of ON-bipolar cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002239-Schroeter1">[33]</xref>. Amacrine cells were visualized with the <italic>ptf1a:Gal4VP16</italic> line previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002239-Williams1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002239-Pisharath1">[29]</xref>, kindly provided by the Wong lab (UW, Biological Structure), crossed to the <italic>UAS:</italic>mYFP line also described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002239-Williams1">[28]</xref>.

Injected eggs were raised to 5 dpf and then tested for blindness by OKR. The ERG response of animals separated into OKR positive and negative pools was then examined one day later at 6 dpf. These experiments were repeated three times.</p><p>Electroretinograms were recorded as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002239-Wong1">[24]</xref>. Briefly, 5 and 6 dpf larvae were anesthetized in tricaine and eyes were removed using a fine tungsten wire loop. Excised eyes were then placed in an oxygenated Ringer's solution (in mM; 130 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 20 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 0.7 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.0 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 20 glucose), and a glass electrode was positioned directly onto the cornea. After 3 minutes (min) of dark adaptation, eyes were exposed to white light flashes and their electrical responses recorded. Data was acquired and processed as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002239-VanEpps1">[54]</xref>. Peak values are listed as the mean &#177; standard deviation. All recordings are an average of at least 6 animals.</p><p>For drug treatments, fish at 6 dpf were allowed to swim in embryo media with the drug for 1 min, and then treated as above with Ringer's solution also containing the drug. Drugs were dissolved and stored as recommended by the manufacturer (Tocris bioscience, Ellisville, Missouri). Picrotoxin was used at 25 &#181;M and DNQX at 50 &#181;M. In most cases eyes showed the drug effect after the standard 3 min dark adaptation. However, for picrotoxin eyes required 8 min of dark adaptation before the drug effects stabilized. An 8 min dark adaptation did not change the ERG in the absence of drugs.</p><p>Fish were grown to the indicated age in days, euthanized by immersion in ice, and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (1&#215; PBS, 3% sucrose) for 2 hrs at room temperature (rt) or overnight (o/n) at 4&#176;C. Fixed fish were washed 1&#215; in PBS and then immersed in 30% sucrose (1&#215; PBS) o/n at 4&#176;C. Fish were incubated in 50% OCT, 15% sucrose for 30 min at rt then frozen in 100% OCT on dry ice. 16&#8211;20 &#181;M slices were cut using a Leica CM1850 cryostat.</p><p>Mutant and sibling OKR-positive larvae (a mixture of WT and heterozygotes) were observed by light microscopy as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002239-Schmitt1">[55]</xref>.</p><p>Slides were washed 3&#215; with PBS, incubated at rt for 1 hr in blocking buffer (1&#215;PBS, 0.3% Triton X-100, 3% lamb serum), and then treated with primary antibody in blocking buffer o/n at 4&#176;C. Primary antibodies used were calretinin (Millipore, 1&#8758;500), parvalbumin (Millipore, 1&#8758;200), 5E11 (a generous gift from J. Fadool, 1&#8758;50 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002239-Fadool1">[25]</xref>), and CHAT (Millipore, 1&#8758;30). For the CHAT antibody slides were boiled for 10 min in 10 mM sodium citrate after the first PBS wash, and lamb serum was replaced with donkey serum. After primary incubation slides were washed 3&#215; in PBS and then incubated with secondary antibody diluted (1&#8758;1000) in PBS for 1 hr at rt. Secondary antibodies used were Alexiflour 568 and 488, anti-rabbit, goat and mouse (Invitrogen). Slides were washed 3&#215; with PBS, mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories), and imaged using a 60&#215; objective (N.A. 1.35) and an Olympus FV1000 scanning confocal microscope.</p><p>Cell bodies were counted in sections that showed a portion of the optic nerve ensuring that the same regions of the eye were counted. Z-stacks were taken with a step size of 1 &#181;M and the cells from 10 consecutive stacks were counted for each eye. The counts are shown as cells per 10 &#181;M thick eye section. At least 6 eyes were counted for each condition. For M&#252;ller cell counts images were taken of live animals as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002239-Williams1">[28]</xref>. Images were rendered in 3D using the programs Metamorph (Medical Devices) and Amira (Visage Imaging), and cells were counted over a 50 &#181;M area of retina.</p><p>Fish were fixed for 15 min in 4% paraformaldehyde and prepared for cyrosectioning. Cryosections of WT and mutant fish were immunolabled with 1&#8758;300 rabbit anti-PKC &#946;1 (Sigma sc-209, secondary anti-rabbit Alexiflour 488 1&#8758;1000) and 1&#8758;2500 anti-GABA&#947;2 (a generous gift from Prof. Jean-Marc Fritschy, University of Zurich; secondary anti-guinea pig Alexiflour 568). Slides were imaged with the Olympus FV1000, and the two colors were collected sequentially in 0.3 &#181;m z stacks. Stacks were assembled in Amira and the 3D volume of PKC-labeled bipolar terminals was labeled. Only terminals that were completely encompassed by the image, and could be accurately separated from their neighbors, were labeled. 15&#8211;25 terminals were labeled per image. The 3D label field of the bipolar terminals was then used to mask the GABA signal. Dots were counted within the individual label fields in randomized blind samples. After counts were made, samples were categorized as either mutant or non-mutant. The volume of each terminal label field was also determined. The final value is an average of counts/&#181;m<sup>3</sup> &#177; standard error for 3 different fish and 60 total terminals from each genotype.</p><p>In situs were performed using sense and antisense RNA probes to either Exon 1 (nt 2327&#8211;nt 3541) or the 3&#8242;UTR (434 bp fragment with 214 bp within the final exon) of <italic>celsr3</italic>. Whole mount and slide in situs were conducted as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002239-Thisse1">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002239-Barthel1">[57]</xref>, except that for slide in situs the proteinase K step was not performed and 10% polyvinyl alcohol (MW 35,000&#8211;50,000; Sigma) was added to the NBT, BCIP staining solution. For IHC, ISH sections were postfixed for 20 min at rt in 4% paraformaldehyde, 1&#215; PBS, before starting the IHC protocol.</p><p>Blastula transplants were performed as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002239-CarmanyRampey1">[58]</xref>. Images of the transplant were taken at 2 dpf using a Zeiss Discovery V12 epifluorescence stereomicroscope. The fish were allowed to grow to 5 dpf and were then tested for OKR and genotyped by sequencing.</p>
