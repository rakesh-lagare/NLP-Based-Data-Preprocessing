For details of the generation and analysis of <italic>Hand2</italic> mice and embryos see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000901.s009">Text S1</xref>.</p><p>For IP, fore- and hind-limb buds from E11.0 embryos were collected in PBS and lysed in lysis buffer (Tris-HCl 10 mM pH 8.0; EDTA 1 mM; NaCl 140 mM; Triton 1%; SDS 0.1%; NaDeoxycholate 0.1%). Protein lysates (about 300 mg) were incubated overnight at 4&#176;C with the anti-Hand2 (M-19, Santa Cruz; 1 mg) and protein G beads were added the next morning for about 5 hours at 4&#176;C. After several washes in lysis buffer, beads were resuspended in Laemmli loading buffer and SDS-PAGE was performed under non-reducing conditions. Goat IgG antibodies were used as control. For Co-IP of endogenous embryonic proteins, 50 limb buds at E10.5 were dissected in PBS and processed as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000901-Chen1">[33]</xref>. The Hoxd13 or control rabbit IgG antibodies used for co-IPs were covalently cross-linked to G protein beads and bound proteins were detected with Hand2 antibodies (AF3876, R&amp;D System).</p><p>ChIP was performed using wild-type fore- and hindlimb buds at E11.0 (38&#8211;42 somites). For each experiment, 85 limb buds were dissected, pooled and the freshly cross-linked chromatin divided among the starting samples. The average size of the DNA fragments in the cross-linked and sonicated chromatin was &#8764;500&#8211;2000 bp. Samples were processed as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000901-Vokes2">[62]</xref> with the following modifications: protein G magnetic beads (Dynabeads, Invitrogen) were pre-absorbed with goat IgG (1&#8211;2 mg for 30 ml of beads for each sample) for minimally 1 hour at 4&#176;C. After washing them with BSA-PBS (5 mg/ml), the beads were added to the chromatin extracts and gently rocked for 1 hour at 4&#176;C. Afterwards, beads were spun down and the chromatin in the supernatant transferred to a new tube and incubated overnight with Hand2 antibodies (M-19, Santa Cruz; 1 mg) or goat IgG antibodies as control (1 mg). The following day, 25 ml of beads were added and the DNA-immunocomplexes were precipitated for 4 hours at 4&#176;C. ChIP-enriched DNA samples were amplified by Q-PCR and conventional PCR. To compute the enrichment for a particular amplicon, its values were compared with the ones of a completely unrelated amplicon within the mouse <italic>&#946;-actin</italic> gene that provides an additional negative control. The <italic>&#946;-actin</italic> gene is located &#8764;114 Mb downstream of the ZRS on mouse chromosome 5. The fold of enrichment was then calculated as the fold of increase in the specific signal in relation to the values obtained when using non-specific goat IgGs for ChIP (values set arbitrarily at 1). All oligos used are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000901.s008">Table S1</xref>. Three ChIP experiments were performed using completely independent and fresh (i.e. non-frozen) chromatin preparations. The values obtained were analyzed and the graphs shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000901-g004">Figure 4D</xref> (means &#177; standard error) were drawn using the Prism Graphpad Software (La Jolla, USA). The statistical significance of all results was assessed using the Mann-Whitney test as part of the Prism software package.</p><p>Mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts were plated on 24-well plates and transfected using Lipofectamine LTX (Invitrogen) including a total of 500 ng of DNA. Reporter constructs were co-transfected with 100 ng of <italic>Hand2</italic> and/or <italic>Hoxd13</italic> and/or <italic>Gli3</italic> expression constructs in combination with a <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase vector. A detailed description of the generation of the expression constructs is available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000901.s009">Text S1</xref>. Cells were collected 28&#8211;30 hours post-transfection and luciferase reporter assays were performed using the Dual Luciferase Kit (Promega). Each assay was repeated at least 10 times. It is important to note that NIH3T3 cells do not express the endogenous <italic>Hand2</italic>, <italic>Hoxd13</italic> and <italic>Gli3</italic> genes (data not shown).
